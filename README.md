Zsh modules providing zshâ†”Python bindings

Former name: zsh/zpython. Module adds command `zpython` that is to be used like 
this:

    zmodload libzpython
    zpython "${PYTHON_CODE}"

. Inside python code you may use `zsh` module: e.g.

    zpython "import zsh; print (dir(zsh))"

. For documentation please refer to either `man zpython` (assuming you have it 
installed) or usual python docstrings attached to `zsh` module methods.

# Building and installation

Zpython supports the following variants of building:

1. If you have installed zsh using something like my ebuild: (minimal variant 
   that installs all necessary headers)

         	if use doc ; then

    , then all you need is `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make`. The 
    resulting `build/libzpython.so` executable must be placed somewhere where 
    zsh can find it: under any directory listed in `$module_path` array.

    You may use this variant with any zsh assuming you can get relevant 
    `config.h`.
2. If you have built your own zsh version then another variant is available: use

        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake .. -DZSH_REPOSITORY=/path/to/built/zsh

    . This way zpython will use given repository for building: it will take 
    headers from there and also use zsh executable at that location.

Building requires zsh, CMake 2.8.7 or greater, Python-2 2.6 or greater or 
Python-3 3.2 or greater, yodl 3.\* for building man pages.

Some useful CMake options:

`-DZSH_REPOSITORY=/path/to/zsh/repository`: build using existing zsh repository 
(described above).

`-DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/path/to/libpython.so`: build using given Python library.

`-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/Python/include/directory`: build using given 
Python include directory (i.e. directory where `Python.h` is located).

`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local`: installation prefix. Is only used for 
determining where to install manual page. `libzpython.so` installation directory 
is the first directory in zsh `$module_path` variable when zsh is launched using 
`zsh -fc 'echo -n $module_path[1]'`.

# Known bugs

Zpython module is known to not support module reloading. This works:

    zsh -c 'zmodload libzpython; zmodload -u libzpython; zmodload libzpython'

. This also works:

    zsh
    % # The following command will load libzpython module and intall powerline prompt
    % . ${PATH_TO_POWERLINE}/powerline/bindings/zsh/powerline.zsh
    > zmodload -u libzpython
    % . ${PATH_TO_POWERLINE}/powerline/bindings/zsh/powerline.zsh

. But if you try to uncomment `zmodload -u libzpython` in provided tests zsh 
will crash.
